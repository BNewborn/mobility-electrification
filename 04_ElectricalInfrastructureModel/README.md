# 4 - Developing our electricity-demand model

This directory is no longer used for active development.

The below was written 6/20/2022

This folder houses the code and tests ran to build the first version of our electricity-demand model.

The model was first developed in a [notebook](ElectricalModel_Steps.ipynb). But to make it more portable and easier for re-use, it was then moved into a [class](electrical_model.py), similar to our Commuter Model. While this, similarly, is not the final or current version of the model being used, it was our first proof of concept. The class was tested in [this notebook](<Test Electrical Model Class.ipynb>)
