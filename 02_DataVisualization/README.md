As part of our ongoing work with our client, we put together interim visualization proofs of concept as we developed our datasets and models. This folder shows the code we used to reformat and restructure data for visualizations early in our work. An example of these visualizations, done in kepler.gl, can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/120s0M0PLgM4lErTZtkxZs3Z2uabYexKI8DNpCf8cAlE/edit?usp=sharing)
